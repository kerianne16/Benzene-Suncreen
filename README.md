# Benzene Suncreen

Benzene is a well known cancer causing solvent. It has been shown to cause cancers such as leukemia in humans. 

## Problem

Valisure detected Benzene in sunscreen in over 78 sunscreen and after sun products. They publicly released the entire document outlining the products they tested and the levels on Benzene detected. 

This document is dense and hard to navigate. 

## Solution

I took it upon myself to create an app to help navigate the document quickly and efficiently. This gives people the abilty to check if a product has benzene without having to scroll through a huge document.
